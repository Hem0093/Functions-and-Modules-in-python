task1-------------->


working---->

this python program is use to calculate the factorial of any number by some potints which are given blow:
1. use the int-inputfunction for input value
2. and use def function named factorial
3. use if and else condition
4. if input number is less than 2 it return to 1 , and if input number is grater than 2 it return n*factorial(n-1)
5.  in 2nd last i call the function
6.  in last i use print statement 


Task2------------->

working---->
this python program deals with the mathemathical operations like find sin angle value, algorithm of a number also find the squuare root of number by some proocess which is given blow:

1. first imoprt math
2. if we find sqaure root ofnumber use the math.sqrt('number')
3. if we find algorithm of input number we use math.log('number')
4. if we find sine angle of input number we use math.sin('number')

5. in lastwe use print function of these
